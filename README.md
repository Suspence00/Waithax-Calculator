# Waithax-Calculator
A Calculator to use your current hex value to determine time remaining while using Waithax

Website w/ Calculator: http://waithaxcalc.spencers.website/

**Latest v1.9:**
* Added percentage completed and time elapsed
* Further cleaned up code w/ comments

v1.85:
* Starting Hex and Drop rate are now modifiable (though, not recommend except for experimental purposes as the default values are the same across all 3ds devices surveyed so far
* To-do: Implement percentage left and amount of time passed)

v1.8:
* Fixed issues with time increasing instead of decreasing (but actually this time)
* Now only hex needed is the current one as 0x1010101 has been confirmed as the starting hex and 0x10000 as the hex drop rate. These are * * both still editable (though now at the bottom of the input list) in case you decide to mess with it.
* Note: Changing the starting hex currently has no effect, TBA
* New Source code pasted here: https://github.com/Suspence00/Waithax-Calculator

v1.5:
* Fixed issues with time increasing instead of decreasing
* Commented and edited the Spaghetti code

v1.1:
* Added default values and commented source code for future implementations

v1: Initial

I programmed a calculator for figuring out how much time is remaining while using Waithax https://3ds.guide/dsiware-downgrade-\(save-injection\). This probably isn't perfect, I'm open to any and all suggestions (I'm a novice coder at best). 

I've gotten so much from the 3ds homebrew community, hopefully this helps someone out!
