**v1.5 is now live**

*  Fixed issues with time increasing instead of decreasing

*  Commented and edited the spaghetti code
*  New Source code pasted here: [https://gist.github.com/anonymous/40515ed9e70eff5f8a3b044d07bd29a8](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/40515ed9e70eff5f8a3b044d07bd29a8)

I programmed a calculator for figuring out how much time is remaining while using [Waithax](https://3ds.guide/dsiware-downgrade-\(save-injection\)). This probably isn't perfect, I'm open to any and all suggestions (I'm a novice coder at best). 

I've gotten so much from the 3ds homebrew community, hopefully this helps someone out!
